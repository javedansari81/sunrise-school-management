# Teacher Profile Fixes - Testing Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Data Display Issue ✅
- **Problem**: Teacher EMP001 was displaying "Amit Updated Kumar" instead of "Amit Kumar"
- **Root Cause**: Database corruption with "Updated" text in name fields
- **Solution**: Created and executed `V008_fix_teacher_name_corruption.sql` to clean corrupted data
- **Fix Applied**: Database script removes "Updated" text and sets correct name "Amit Kumar"

### 2. UI Design Consistency Issue ✅
- **Problem**: Inconsistent label formatting between new teacher form and edit form
- **Root Cause**: New teacher form used asterisks (*) in labels, edit form didn't
- **Solution**: Standardized all forms to use `required` prop without asterisks in labels
- **Changes Made**:
  - Removed asterisks from all field labels in new teacher form
  - Added `required` prop to all required fields
  - Updated both new teacher and edit teacher forms for consistency
  - Follows established pattern used in expense management and other forms
