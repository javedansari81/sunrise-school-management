## Test Execution Guidelines

### For Each Test Case:
1. **Read Prerequisites**: Ensure all preconditions are met
2. **Follow Steps Exactly**: Execute each step as documented
3. **Verify Expected Results**: Check that actual results match expected
4. **Document Issues**: Record any deviations or bugs found
5. **Take Screenshots**: Capture evidence for visual verification
6. **Note Performance**: Observe loading times and responsiveness

### Test Result Documentation:
- [ ] **Pass**: Test executed successfully, all expected results achieved
- [ ] **Fail**: Test failed, document specific failure details
- [ ] **Blocked**: Test cannot be executed due to environment issues
- [ ] **Skip**: Test intentionally skipped with justification

### Issue Reporting Format:
```
**Test Case**: [Test Case Number and Name]
**Issue**: [Brief description of the issue]
**Steps to Reproduce**: [Specific steps that led to the issue]
**Expected Result**: [What should have happened]
**Actual Result**: [What actually happened]
**Severity**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
**Browser/Device**: [Browser and version or device used]
**Screenshot**: [Attach screenshot if applicable]
```

## Post-Test Activities

### Test Summary Report
- [ ] Total test cases executed
- [ ] Pass/Fail/Blocked/Skip counts
- [ ] Critical issues identified
- [ ] Performance observations
- [ ] Browser compatibility summary
- [ ] Accessibility compliance notes

### Bug Triage and Prioritization
- [ ] **Critical**: System crashes, data loss, security vulnerabilities
- [ ] **High**: Major functionality broken, workflow blockers
- [ ] **Medium**: Minor functionality issues, UI problems
- [ ] **Low**: Cosmetic issues, enhancement suggestions

### Regression Testing
- [ ] Re-test failed cases after fixes
- [ ] Verify fixes don't break other functionality
- [ ] Test related functionality for side effects
- [ ] Update test cases if requirements changed

---

## Test Environment Cleanup

### After Test Completion:
- [ ] Clear test data that shouldn't persist
- [ ] Reset user accounts to clean state
- [ ] Document any permanent test data needed
