# üéØ SOLUTION: Backend Connection Fix for Leave Management System

## üîç Root Cause Identified

Your "Backend server is not running" error is caused by **incorrect frontend build configuration**. The frontend was built without the correct `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable, so it's trying to connect to `localhost` instead of your production backend.

## ‚úÖ Test Results Summary

- ‚úÖ **Backend is running and healthy**
- ‚úÖ **Authentication works perfectly**
- ‚úÖ **CORS is configured correctly**
- ‚úÖ **Leave Management API endpoints work**
- ‚ùå **Frontend build missing production API URL**

## üö® IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

### Step 1: Update Frontend Environment Variables on Render.com

1. **Go to Render.com Dashboard**
2. **Click on your Frontend Service** (`sunrise-school-frontend-web`)
3. **Go to Environment Tab**
4. **Add/Update these environment variables:**

```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://sunrise-school-backend-api.onrender.com/api/v1
REACT_APP_SCHOOL_NAME=Sunrise National Public School
```

**CRITICAL:** Make sure there are NO trailing slashes and the URL is exactly:
`https://sunrise-school-backend-api.onrender.com/api/v1`

### Step 2: Redeploy Frontend Service

1. **Go to your Frontend Service page**
2. **Click "Manual Deploy"**
3. **Select "Deploy latest commit"**
4. **Wait for build to complete** (5-10 minutes)

### Step 3: Verify Backend Environment Variables

1. **Go to your Backend Service** (`sunrise-school-backend-api`)
2. **Go to Environment Tab**
3. **Ensure these are set:**

```bash
DATABASE_URL=[Copy from your PostgreSQL service]
SECRET_KEY=sunrise-school-secret-key-2024-production-india
ENVIRONMENT=production
BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS=https://sunrise-school-frontend-web.onrender.com
```

## üß™ Testing After Fix

### Test 1: Check Frontend Build
After redeployment, visit: `https://sunrise-school-frontend-web.onrender.com`

Open browser developer tools (F12) and check:
1. **Console tab** - Should show no API connection errors
2. **Network tab** - API calls should go to `sunrise-school-backend-api.onrender.com`

### Test 2: Test Leave Management System
1. **Login** with: `admin@sunriseschool.edu` / `admin123`
2. **Navigate to Leave Management**
3. **Should load without "Backend server not running" error**

### Test 3: Verify API Calls
In browser developer tools Network tab, you should see API calls to:
- `https://sunrise-school-backend-api.onrender.com/api/v1/leaves/`
- `https://sunrise-school-backend-api.onrender.com/api/v1/configuration/leave-management/`

## üîß Why This Happened

React environment variables like `REACT_APP_API_URL` are **build-time variables**. They get baked into the JavaScript bundle during the build process. If they're not set correctly during build, the frontend will use the default value (`localhost:8000`).

## üìã Verification Checklist

After implementing the fix:

- [ ] Frontend service redeployed with correct `REACT_APP_API_URL`
- [ ] Backend service has correct `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS`
- [ ] Login works without errors
- [ ] Leave Management System loads data
- [ ] No "Backend server not running" errors
- [ ] Browser network tab shows correct API URLs

## üö® If Issues Persist

### Issue 1: Still seeing localhost in API calls
**Solution:** Clear browser cache completely or try incognito mode

### Issue 2: CORS errors in browser console
**Solution:** Verify `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS` exactly matches frontend URL

### Issue 3: Authentication errors
**Solution:** Check if `DATABASE_URL` is correctly set in backend

## üìû Emergency Debugging Commands

Run these to verify your fix:

```bash
# Test backend health
curl https://sunrise-school-backend-api.onrender.com/health

# Test authentication
curl -X POST https://sunrise-school-backend-api.onrender.com/api/v1/auth/login-json \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@sunriseschool.edu","password":"admin123"}'

# Test leave endpoint (with token from above)
curl https://sunrise-school-backend-api.onrender.com/api/v1/leaves/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

## üéâ Expected Result

After this fix:
1. ‚úÖ Leave Management System loads instantly
2. ‚úÖ No "Backend server not running" errors
3. ‚úÖ All CRUD operations work (Create, Read, Update, Delete leaves)
4. ‚úÖ Statistics and reports load correctly
5. ‚úÖ Authentication flows work smoothly

## üìù Prevention for Future

To prevent this issue in future deployments:
1. Always verify environment variables before deploying
2. Use the validation scripts provided to test connections
3. Check browser developer tools after each deployment
4. Keep a deployment checklist with environment variable verification

**The fix is simple but critical: Redeploy your frontend with the correct `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable!**
