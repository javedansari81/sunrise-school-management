# Student Login Implementation

This document describes the implementation of student login functionality for the Sunrise School Management System.

## Overview

Students can now login to the system using either their phone number or email address with a default password of "Sunrise@001". After login, they can view and edit their profile information with appropriate restrictions.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Authentication System
- **Dual Login Support**: Students can login using either email or phone number
- **Backward Compatibility**: Admin and teacher login remains unchanged (email only)
- **Default Password**: All new students get "Sunrise@001" as default password

### 2. Automatic User Account Creation
- User accounts are automatically created when admin adds new students
- Links student records to user accounts for authentication
- Handles cases where students have only phone or only email

### 3. Student Profile Management
- **View Profile**: Students can view their complete profile information
- **Edit Profile**: Students can edit personal, contact, parent, and emergency contact information
- **Field Restrictions**: System-generated fields (admission number, roll number, class, etc.) are read-only
- **Security**: Students can only access their own profile data

### 4. Admin Enhancements
- **Login Credentials Display**: Admin can see student login information in Student Profiles tab
- **Account Status**: Shows which students have login accounts
- **Password Information**: Displays default password for reference

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Enhanced Authentication (`app/crud/crud_user.py`)
```python
async def authenticate(self, db: AsyncSession, *, email: str, password: str) -> Optional[User]:
    # Try email first, then phone number for students
    user = await self.get_by_email(db, email=email)
    if not user:
        user = await self.get_by_phone(db, phone=email)  # 'email' param can be phone
    # ... rest of authentication logic
```

#### 2. Student User Account Creation (`app/crud/crud_student.py`)
```python
async def create_with_validation(self, db: AsyncSession, *, obj_in: StudentCreate) -> Student:
    # Create student record
    db_obj = Student(**obj_in.dict())
    # ... validation logic
    
    # Create user account if email or phone provided
    if obj_in.email or obj_in.phone:
        user_account = User(
            email=user_email,
            hashed_password=get_password_hash("Sunrise@001"),
            # ... other fields
        )
        # Link to student record
        db_obj.user_id = user_account.id
```

#### 3. Student Profile Endpoints (`app/api/v1/endpoints/students.py`)
- `GET /students/my-profile` - Get current student's profile
- `PUT /students/my-profile` - Update current student's profile
- Proper authorization checks ensure students only access their own data

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Enhanced Login Component (`src/components/LoginPopup.tsx`)
- Updated email field to accept phone numbers
- Added helper text for students
- Updated demo credentials

#### 2. Student Profile Component (`src/components/StudentProfile.tsx`)
- Comprehensive profile view with all student information
- Edit mode with field restrictions
- Proper error handling and loading states

#### 3. Profile Page Router (`src/pages/Profile.tsx`)
- Automatically shows StudentProfile for student users
- Falls back to UserProfile for admin/teacher users

#### 4. Admin UI Enhancement (`src/pages/admin/StudentProfiles.tsx`)
- Added "Login Info" column showing student credentials
- Displays default password for admin reference

## Database Schema

### User Account Linking
- `students.user_id` links to `users.id`
- Students can have user accounts for login
- User accounts created automatically during student creation

### User Types
- User type ID 3 = STUDENT (based on metadata table)
- Proper foreign key relationships maintained

## Security Features

### 1. Route Protection
- Students can only access `/profile` and their own data
- Admin routes remain protected from student access
- Proper role-based authorization

### 2. Data Access Control
- Students can only view/edit their own profile
- Read-only fields enforced at API level
- Proper validation and error handling

### 3. Password Security
- Passwords are properly hashed using bcrypt
- Default password can be changed by students (future enhancement)

## Migration and Setup

### 1. Create User Accounts for Existing Students
```bash
cd sunrise-backend-fastapi
python scripts/create_student_user_accounts.py
```

### 2. Test Implementation
```bash
cd sunrise-backend-fastapi
python scripts/test_student_login.py
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Students
1. **Login**: Use phone number or email with password "Sunrise@001"
2. **Profile Access**: Click "Profile" in the header menu after login
3. **Edit Profile**: Click "Edit Profile" button to modify allowed fields
4. **Restrictions**: Cannot modify admission number, roll number, class, or other system fields

### For Admins
1. **View Student Accounts**: Go to Admin â†’ Student Profiles
2. **Login Information**: See "Login Info" column for student credentials
3. **Account Status**: Check which students have login accounts
4. **Password Reset**: Default password is "Sunrise@001" (shown in UI)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Password Change**: Allow students to change their default password
2. **Password Reset**: Implement password reset functionality
3. **Profile Pictures**: Add profile picture upload capability
4. **Notifications**: Email/SMS notifications for account creation
5. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enhanced security for student accounts

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:
