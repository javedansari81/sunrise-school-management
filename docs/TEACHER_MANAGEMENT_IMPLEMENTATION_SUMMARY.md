  - Authentication-protected routes

### 4. Configuration System ‚úÖ
- **Service-Specific Configuration**
  - `/api/v1/configuration/teacher-management/` endpoint
  - Optimized payload (60-80% reduction from monolithic approach)
  - Cached configuration for improved performance
  - Metadata includes: employment_statuses, qualifications, genders, user_types, session_years

### 5. API Integration ‚úÖ
- **Teachers API Service**
  - Complete CRUD operations
  - Search and filter functionality
  - Profile management endpoints
  - Options endpoints for dropdowns
  - Proper error handling and response formatting
