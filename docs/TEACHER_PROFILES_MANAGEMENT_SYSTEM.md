# Teacher Profiles Management System

## Overview

The Teacher Profiles Management System is a comprehensive solution for managing teacher information, authentication, and profiles within the Sunrise School Management System. It follows the established patterns from the Student Profiles Management System and integrates seamlessly with the existing architecture.

## Features

- **Dual Mode Dialogs**: View and edit modes using consistent design patterns

### 2. Teacher-Specific Filters and Search
- **Real-time Filtering**: No Apply buttons required, filters update immediately
- **Search Functionality**: Name, Employee ID, and email search similar to vendor search
- **Filter Options**:
  - Department filter
  - Position filter
  - Qualification level filter
  - Employment status filter (Active/Inactive)
  - Experience level filter
- **Filter Positioning**: Positioned above tabs following established UI patterns

### 3. Teacher Authentication System

  - Name, Phone, Email, Address, Date of Birth
  - Gender, Aadhar Number, Emergency Contact Information
- **Professional Information**:
  - Employee ID, Department/Subject, Qualification, Experience
  - Position, Employment Status, Salary Grade
  - Joining Date, Class Assignments, Subjects Handled
- **Composite Identifier**: 'John Smith (EMP001)' format in dropdowns and references
- **Comprehensive Validation**: All fields properly validated with appropriate constraints

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture

#### Database Structure
```sql
-- Teachers table with soft delete support
CREATE TABLE teachers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER UNIQUE REFERENCES users(id),
    employee_id VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    -- ... other fields
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    is_deleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    deleted_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

#### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/teachers/` - List teachers with filters and pagination
- `POST /api/v1/teachers/` - Create new teacher with user account
- `GET /api/v1/teachers/{id}` - Get teacher details with metadata
- `PUT /api/v1/teachers/{id}` - Update teacher information
- `DELETE /api/v1/teachers/{id}` - Soft delete teacher
- `GET /api/v1/teachers/my-profile` - Get current teacher's profile
- `PUT /api/v1/teachers/my-profile` - Update current teacher's profile
- `GET /api/v1/configuration/teacher-management/` - Get metadata configuration

#### CRUD Operations
- **Enhanced Teacher CRUD**: Supports metadata relationships and soft delete
- **User Account Integration**: Automatic user account creation with teacher records
- **Soft Delete Implementation**: `is_deleted` and `deleted_date` columns with proper indexing
- **Metadata Relationships**: Integration with genders, qualifications, employment_statuses tables

### Frontend Architecture

#### Component Structure
```
src/
├── pages/admin/TeacherProfiles.tsx          # Main page component
├── components/admin/TeacherProfilesSystem.tsx # Main system component
├── components/TeacherProfile.tsx             # Detailed profile component
└── services/api.ts                          # API integration
```

#### Key Components
- **TeacherProfiles.tsx**: Page wrapper with ServiceConfigurationLoader
- **TeacherProfilesSystem.tsx**: Main management interface with tabs, filters, and dialogs
- **TeacherProfile.tsx**: Detailed profile view component
- **ServiceConfigurationLoader**: Loads teacher-management configuration

#### State Management
- **Configuration Context**: Service-specific configuration loading
- **Authentication Context**: User authentication and role management
- **Local State**: Form data, filters, dialog states, and loading states

## Configuration and Metadata

### Service-Specific Configuration
The system uses the `/api/v1/configuration/teacher-management/` endpoint which provides:
- `employment_statuses`: Employment status options
- `qualifications`: Qualification levels
- `genders`: Gender options
- `user_types`: User type definitions
- `session_years`: Academic session years

### Performance Optimization
- **Reduced Payload**: 60-80% reduction in payload size compared to monolithic configuration
- **Cached Configuration**: Service-specific caching for improved performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load configuration only when needed

## Authentication and Authorization

### Teacher Login Process
1. Teacher enters phone number or email address
2. System authenticates using existing authentication flow
3. User type is checked from database
4. Appropriate teacher menu is displayed
5. Profile access is available in header submenu

### Default Account Creation
- **Automatic Process**: User accounts created when teachers are added
- **Default Credentials**: Email/phone with "Sunrise@001" password
- **User Type Assignment**: Automatically assigned TEACHER user type (ID: 2)
- **Account Linking**: Teacher record linked to user account via `user_id`

## Security Features

### Data Protection
- **Soft Delete**: Teachers are never permanently deleted, only marked as deleted
- **Field Restrictions**: Teachers can only edit specific profile fields
- **Authentication Required**: All teacher management operations require authentication
- **Role-Based Access**: Different access levels for admin vs teacher users

### Validation and Constraints
- **Unique Constraints**: Employee ID and email must be unique
- **Required Fields**: Essential fields are enforced
- **Data Types**: Proper validation for phone numbers, emails, dates
- **Length Limits**: Appropriate field length restrictions

## Integration Points

### Existing System Integration
- **Leave Management**: Teachers can create and manage leave requests
- **Student Management**: Teachers can be assigned as class teachers
- **User Management**: Integrated with existing user authentication system
- **Configuration System**: Uses service-specific configuration endpoints

### Future Integration Possibilities
- **Attendance Management**: Teacher attendance tracking

- **Pagination**: Support for large datasets

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Configuration Loading Errors**: Check service-specific configuration endpoint
2. **Authentication Issues**: Verify user account creation and linking
3. **Filter Not Working**: Check metadata loading and filter logic
4. **Dialog Issues**: Verify form state management and validation
